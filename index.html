            <p>Hello! I'm a career-switcher currently studying at Rocket Academy - a vocational coding school in Singapore.<br>
            I was most recently a Business Analyst with the Ministry of Manpower's Work Pass Integrated System.<br>
            There, I nurtured a budding interest in agile product development and was trained in scrum and user experience design.<br><br>
            Prior to my time in the public service, I was a business, psychology, and communications student with internship experience in the media and banking industries. In my spare time, I run a competitive football club for women and volunteer with the Waterways Watch Society.<br>
            </p>
